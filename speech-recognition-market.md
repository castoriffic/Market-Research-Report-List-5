<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Speech Recognition Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Speaker Dependent</li><li>Speaker Independent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Speaker dependent speech recognition systems require users to train the system by speaking specific words or phrases before accurately transcribing their speech. These systems are tailored to individual users and offer greater accuracy but require more initial setup. On the other hand, speaker-independent systems do not require prior training and can recognize a wide range of voices and accents. They are more convenient for general use but may not be as precise as speaker-dependent systems. Both types cater to different needs and preferences in the speech recognition market.</p></p>

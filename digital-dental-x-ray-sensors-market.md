<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Dental X Ray Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intraoral X-rays</li><li>Extraoral X-rays</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Digital dental x-ray sensors are used in both intraoral and extraoral x-ray imaging. Intraoral x-rays involve sensors being placed inside the mouth to capture detailed images of individual teeth and surrounding tissues. These sensors are smaller in size and offer higher resolution imaging. On the other hand, extraoral x-rays involve sensors placed outside the mouth to capture broader images of the entire mouth and jaw. These sensors are larger and provide a wider view of the oral cavity for diagnostic purposes.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental Bonding Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Total-etch System</li><li>Self-etch System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dental bonding agents are classified into two main types: Total-etch System and Self-etch System. In a Total-etch System, the tooth surface is first etched with an acidic solution to create a rough surface for better adhesion. The adhesive is then applied followed by the bonding agent. In a Self-etch System, the bonding agent contains both etching and bonding components, simplifying the process by etching and bonding the tooth surface simultaneously. Both systems have their advantages and are chosen based on the specific needs of the dental procedure.</p></p>

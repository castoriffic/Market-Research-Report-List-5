<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thick Film Photoresist Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Photoresists</li><li>Negative Photoresists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Thick Film Photoresist market is categorized into positive and negative photoresists. Positive photoresists become soluble when exposed to light, allowing the design pattern to be developed and transferred onto the substrate. They are favored for applications requiring high-resolution patterns. In contrast, negative photoresists harden upon light exposure, leaving the unexposed areas removable, which is advantageous for creating robust, durable layers. Both types are essential in various industries, including electronics and microfabrication, enabling precise patterning techniques.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Embolic Microspheres Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid</li><li>Solid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Embolic microspheres are used in minimally invasive procedures to block blood flow in targeted blood vessels. There are two main types of embolic microspheres: liquid and solid. Liquid embolic microspheres are made of biocompatible materials and can be injected into blood vessels in a liquid form that solidifies upon contact with blood. Solid embolic microspheres are pre-formed particles that can be delivered through a catheter to occlude blood vessels. Both types are used in various medical procedures like embolization therapy to treat conditions such as uterine fibroids, liver tumors, and aneurysms.</p></p>

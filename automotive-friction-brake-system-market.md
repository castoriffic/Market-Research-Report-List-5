<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Friction Brake System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Disc Brake</li><li>Drum Brake</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the automotive industry, there are two main types of friction brake systems: disc brakes and drum brakes. Disc brakes use calipers to squeeze brake pads against a rotor to slow down or stop the vehicle. They are known for their better heat dissipation and stopping power. On the other hand, drum brakes use brake shoes that press against the inner surface of a drum to create friction and slow down the vehicle. Drum brakes are typically used in less demanding applications due to their lower heat dissipation capabilities.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Consumer Grade Inkjet Printer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Piezoelectric Type</li><li>Thermal Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Consumer grade inkjet printers come in two main types: Piezoelectric and Thermal. Piezoelectric printers use a piezoelectric crystal that deforms when an electric current is applied, ejecting droplets of ink onto the paper. Thermal printers, on the other hand, use a heating element to heat the ink and create bubbles that force the ink onto the paper. Both types have their own strengths and weaknesses, with Piezoelectric printers typically offering higher print quality and durability, while Thermal printers are often more cost-effective and faster.</p></p>

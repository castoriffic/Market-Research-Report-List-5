<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electronic Filter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Pass Filter</li><li>High-Pass Filter</li><li>Band-Pass Filter</li><li>Band-Stop Filter</li><li>All-Pass Filter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electronic filters are divided into various types based on their frequency response. Low-pass filters allow frequencies below a certain cutoff frequency to pass through, while blocking higher frequencies. High-pass filters do the opposite, allowing higher frequencies to pass through while blocking lower frequencies. Band-pass filters allow a specific band of frequencies to pass through and block others. Band-stop filters, on the other hand, block a specific band of frequencies while allowing others to pass through. All-pass filters allow all frequencies to pass through at different phase shifts.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Profilometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Profilometer</li><li>Non-contact Profilometer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Contact Profilometer and Non-contact Profilometer are both types of instruments used for measuring surface profiles. Contact Profilometers make physical contact with the surface being measured, using a stylus to trace the surface and collect data. Non-contact Profilometers, on the other hand, use techniques such as lasers, optics, or sensors to measure surface profiles without physically touching the surface. Both types of Profilometers offer precise and accurate measurements but are used in different applications depending on the specific requirements of the measurement task.</p></p>

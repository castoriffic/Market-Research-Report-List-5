<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pyranometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermopile Pyranometers</li><li>Photovoltaic Pyranometers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pyranometers are devices used to measure solar irradiance. There are two main types on the market: thermopile pyranometers and photovoltaic pyranometers. Thermopile pyranometers measure solar radiation by generating a voltage proportional to the temperature difference between their absorbing surface and outer dome. Photovoltaic pyranometers, on the other hand, use photovoltaic cells to directly convert solar radiation into electrical current. Both types are crucial for various applications, such as meteorology, solar energy monitoring, and agriculture.</p></p>

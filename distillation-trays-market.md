<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Distillation Trays Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bubble Cap Trays</li><li>Sieve Trays</li><li>Valve Trays</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Distillation trays are important components in distillation columns that aid in the separation of liquid mixtures by providing surface area for vapor-liquid interaction. The three main types of distillation trays are bubble cap trays, sieve trays, and valve trays. Bubble cap trays use dome-shaped caps to separate vapor and liquid phases, sieve trays have holes for vapor passage while retaining liquid, and valve trays have movable valves to control flow. Each type offers unique advantages and is selected based on specific process requirements.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Natural Gas Pipeline Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gathering Pipelines</li><li>Transportation Pipelines</li><li>Distribution Pipelines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Natural gas pipelines are categorized into three main market types: gathering pipelines, transportation pipelines, and distribution pipelines. Gathering pipelines are responsible for collecting raw natural gas from extraction sites and delivering it to processing plants. Transportation pipelines then transport the processed natural gas from the plants to distribution centers and end users. Distribution pipelines distribute natural gas directly to residential, commercial, and industrial customers. Each type of pipeline plays a crucial role in efficiently delivering natural gas throughout the supply chain.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ash Handling System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Type</li><li>Dry Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ash handling systems are used to dispose of the ash produced during the combustion of solid fuels in power plants. There are two main types of ash handling systems: wet type and dry type. Wet type systems involve mixing ash with water to form slurry, which is then transported through pipes. Dry type systems involve collecting ash in a dry form and either disposing of it in landfills or recycling it for other purposes. Both systems have their own advantages and are used based on the specific requirements of power plants.</p></p>

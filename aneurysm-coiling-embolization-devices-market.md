<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aneurysm Coiling & Embolization Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Embolic Coils</li><li>Flow Diversion Devices</li><li>Liquid Embolic Agents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The aneurysm coiling and embolization devices market comprises three primary types: embolic coils, flow diversion devices, and liquid embolic agents. Embolic coils are wire-like stents inserted into aneurysms to promote clotting and prevent blood flow. Flow diversion devices divert blood away from the aneurysm, allowing it to heal while maintaining normal vessel function. Liquid embolic agents are injected to occlude blood vessels, creating a permanent blockage. Together, these technologies offer varied treatment options for cerebrovascular and peripheral aneurysms.</p></p>

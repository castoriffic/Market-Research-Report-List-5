<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self Expanding Metal Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fully</li><li>Partially</li><li>Uncovered</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fully covered self-expanding metal stents are designed with a polymer cover that fully encapsulates the stent, preventing tissue ingrowth and fluid leakage. Partially covered stents have a cover that only partially encapsulates the stent, allowing for some tissue ingrowth while preventing excessive ingrowth. Uncovered stents have no covering, allowing for maximum tissue ingrowth but may be associated with a higher risk of tissue overgrowth and impaction. Each type of stent has its own unique benefits and considerations for specific clinical scenarios.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photoelectric Vacuum Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External Photoelectric Effect Detector</li><li>Internal Photoelectric Effect Detector</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Photoelectric vacuum detectors are commonly categorized into two main types based on the mechanism of the photoelectric effect they rely on: External Photoelectric Effect Detectors and Internal Photoelectric Effect Detectors. </p><p>External detectors utilize the photoelectric effect at the vacuum-window interface, where photons strike the surface and release electrons, creating a photocurrent. Internal detectors, on the other hand, rely on photoelectric effects occurring within the vacuum chamber itself. Both types play a crucial role in various applications such as particle physics experiments, mass spectrometry, and semiconductor processing.</p></p>
